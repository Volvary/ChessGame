# ChessGame
A small chess game built in UE4.


#Intent of project

- This Chess game, while simple, was an attempt at keeping my brain occupied with concrete logic problems with a known goal.

#Project considerations

- While working, a special attention was put to keep the project running in a way that would make it easy to turn into a multiplayer game.
